				<h4>ANZNMF 2016</h4>
				<p align="justify">On behalf of the Australia and New Zealand Microfluidics Group, it is our pleasure to invite you to attend the 7th Australia and New Zealand Nano-Microfluidics Symposium (ANZNMF). The 7th ANZNMF Symposium will be held at the Eco-centre, Griffith University, Brisbane from 21st - 23rd March 2016. The relaxed outdoor lifestyle and warm March weather in Brisbane will be the perfect backdrop for the 7th ANZNMF Symposium and the social functions and networking opportunities that await you. 
				
				<br><br> The Symposium will provide an exciting forum for both formal presentations (Plenary, Keynote, Invited) of frontier micro/nanofluidic research and ample opportunities for informal discussions, laboratory tours and networking. The Symposium will also offer contributed oral and poster presentations from submitted abstracts.The program will cover all areas of micro/nanofluidics fundamentals, engineering developments, and technologies from the latest innovations in fabrication, characterisation, processing and modeling as well as future materials and devices.  

				<br><br>We hope that you will join us for the 7th ANZNMF Symposium in Brisbane. </p>
